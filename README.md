# Stocks_Analysis

## Overview of Project
   
   Analysis of stock data to make predictions on the best possible return investment.

### Purpose
   
   The overall purpose is to calculate total daily volume and yearly return for each stock in the data for any year. The total daily volume and yearly return are parameters used to predict whether a stock is worth investing in or not. 
  
  More specifically, Excel and Visual Basic will be used to analyze, calculate and automate the predictions on which stock will be the better investment. By writing macros to calculate the total daily volume and the yearly return for each stock we can automate the process. By summing up the daily volume for each stock, the yearly volume is calculated and a rough idea of the value of the stock. It's suggested that the higher the volume the more often the stock is traded and therefore the price is a better predictor of the value of the stock. By calculating the yearly return for each stock we can measure how each stock is performing. The yearly return shows the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 
  
  To improve performance analysis on larger datasets, the original code and a refactored version will calculate how long the macro/code takes to execute and output. The code with the shortest run-time will be used to improve performance.


 
## Results

So which stock/s performed better for years 2017 and 2018?
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Did refactoring make our script run faster?

By refactoring the code we improved the performance of the script. Most likely this was done by using less memory or taking few steps, the logic was pretty much the same as the original.

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
